# Apollonian Circles

A simple art app where you click to create circles. The longer you hold, the larger the circle gets. Circles collide and stop growing if they run out of space. You can zoom in (a lot).

# Why

Developed as a technical challenge. Currently uses SVG to render circles, but will use WebGPU in next iterations.
